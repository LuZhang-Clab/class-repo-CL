    <h1> Ode to the Night </h1>
    <p /> The dark night rises from the earth
    <p />conceals the brilliance of the sky
    <p /> The deserted earth after the harvest
    <p />The dark night rises within you
    <p /> you come from afar
    <p /> as I leave for faraway
    <p /> A long journey, passing through
    <p /> The sky has nothing to offer
    <p /> But why does it comfort me?
