    <h1> Ode to the Night </h1>
    <p> The dark night rises from the earth
        conceals the brilliance of the sky
        The deserted earth after the harvest
        The dark night rises within you
        you come from afar
        as I leave for faraway
        A long journey, passing through
        The sky has nothing to offer
        But why does it comfort me?
